# Features Missing or Not Fully Implemented (as of Feb 2026)

## Recently Scaffolded/Planned
- Health check API endpoint: Implemented in app/api/health (liveness, readiness, full checks)
- Automated backup/restore: Bash scripts in scripts/backup for MongoDB backup/restore
- Rate limiting: Middleware scaffolded in app/api/lib/rate-limit.ts
- Internationalization (i18n): Config scaffolded in lib/i18n.ts
- Audit log viewing UI: Scaffolded in components/AuditLogViewer.tsx

## Still Missing or Not Fully Implemented
1. **Accessibility Audits**
	- No automated accessibility testing or audit scripts mentioned.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**
	- No .github/ or similar directory for workflow configuration found.
3. **Mobile App or PWA Support**
	- No mention of mobile app or explicit PWA support.
4. **User Impersonation for Admins**
	- No admin user impersonation feature mentioned.
5. **Multi-Tenancy**
	 - Multi-tenancy context utilities scaffolded in lib/tenant.ts. Tenant model pattern present. To fully implement:
		 - Ensure all core models (Patient, Appointment, etc.) include tenantId field and index.
		 - Use getTenantContext() or getTenantId() in API handlers to scope data per tenant.
		 - Add tenant onboarding/admin UI as needed.
6. **Automated Dependency Audits**
	- No mention of automated dependency audit tools/scripts.
7. **API Versioning**
	- API versioning scaffolded: /api/v1/ endpoints now supported (see app/api/v1/)
8. **Customizable Notification Templates**
	- No mention of customizable notification/email/SMS templates.
9. **User Activity Analytics**
	- No explicit user activity analytics (logins, usage patterns) described.

If you want to prioritize or implement any of these, review the README and codebase for further planning.
Automated Backups & Restore

The README and best practices mention automated database backups and restore procedures, but there is no clear mention of backup/restore scripts, endpoints, or documentation in the visible structure.
Health Checks & Monitoring

Health checks for production readiness are recommended, but there is no explicit mention of a health check endpoint (e.g., /api/health) or monitoring scripts.
Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is mentioned as a best practice, but there is no clear evidence of middleware or configuration for rate limiting in the API layer.
Internationalization (i18n)

There is no mention or evidence of i18n support (multiple languages/locales) in the UI or backend.
Accessibility Audits

While accessibility is mentioned, there is no explicit mention of automated accessibility testing or audits.
CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

The README recommends CI/CD, but there is no .github or similar directory visible for workflow configuration.
Mobile App or PWA Support

There is no mention of a mobile app or explicit PWA (Progressive Web App) support.
User Impersonation for Admins

Some advanced admin features (like user impersonation for troubleshooting) are not mentioned.
Multi-Tenancy

If the app is intended for multiple clinics/organizations, there is no mention of multi-tenancy support.
Audit Log Viewing UI

While audit logging is implemented, a dedicated UI for viewing and filtering audit logs is not explicitly mentioned.
Automated Dependency Audits

Regular dependency audits are recommended, but there is no mention of automated tools/scripts for this.
API Versioning

No mention of API versioning strategy (e.g., /api/v1/).
Customizable Notification Templates

Notification/email/SMS templates are not mentioned as customizable.
User Activity Analytics

While reporting is present, user activity analytics (logins, usage patterns) are not explicitly mentioned.
