# User Activity Analytics Plan

1. Track user logins, actions, and page views in audit logs or analytics database.
2. Add API endpoints for retrieving user activity stats (e.g., /api/admin/user-activity).
3. Build admin dashboard UI for viewing activity trends, most active users, etc.
4. Optionally, integrate with external analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Matomo).
5. Document analytics features in docs/USER_ACTIVITY_ANALYTICS.md.

Example tracked events:
- Login/logout
- Appointment booking
- Prescription creation
- Document upload/download

Next steps:
- Add tracking logic to key actions
- Scaffold analytics API and UI
- Document feature
